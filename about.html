				Being able to lead and communicate effectively are core elements of life goals... including New Year's resolutions.  This program: "ONE Goal to a Better Life" will help you chart a path to your goal by using opportunities in Toastmasters. 
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
					<strong>Q:</strong> How? 
				<br/>
				<strong>A:</strong> You will apply Toastmasters' research-proven techniques to achieving goals. The simple process is: set a goal, commit to it, work on it, track it,  and get support from others. A section of this website will show you how to use Toastmaster objectives (link c) to reach your goal.
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				<strong>Q:</strong> Really?
				<br/>
				<strong>A:</strong> Think about it - you have used these principles to move along in Toastmasters - whether you have achieved your CC or CL or are working toward your DTM.
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				<strong>Q:</strong> What type of life goals does this encompass?
				<br/>
				<strong>A:</strong> Just about anything. Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to run a marathon? Do you want to have a better relationship - with your spouse, your parents, your children or your friends? Do you want to get a promotion at work? Do you want to run for public office? We - the D28 Toastmasters community - can help you achieve it.
				Or, you can apply the "ONE goal" strictly to your Toastmaster education objective. With that, you'll get extra support and encouragement in finishing your manuals and completing leadership projects. 
			</p>


			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				<strong>Q:</strong> How often do I need to go online?
				</br>
				<strong>A:</strong> Work out your own pace, but weekly check-ins are advised. Each month, you should be able to show progress toward your goal. 
			</p>

			<h4>"SMART" Goals </h4>
			 

				 

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>


				SMART: goals should be: <em><strong>S</strong></em>pecific, <em><strong>M</strong></em>easurable, <em><strong>A</strong></em>chievable, 
						<em><strong>R</strong></em>elevant, and <em><strong>T</strong></em>ime-bound.
			</p>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>

				Other suggested goals:

			</p>

				<ul>
				<li>Become more social. </li>
				<li>Build my network of business associates (try going to advanced clubs)</li>
				<li>Become a professional speaker.</li>
				<li>Get a promotion at work.</li>
				<li>Start my own business.</li>
				<li>Become president of my homeowners' association.</li>
				<li>Build regular exercise into my lifestyle.</li>
				<li>Take charge of my finances. </li>
				</ul>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				For some of the larger goals, research the topic and write and deliver a speech about it. Develop the topic into table topic questions. Make the subject of your goal the "word of the day." Make it part of the opening message at your home club. Visit a neighboring club and deliver a speech about your goal. Your goal can be broken down into different aspects. For example, a diet involves a nutritional game plan, exercise, elimination of bad habits (don't eat ice cream every night while watching TV) and keeping a food journal. Each of these aspects of dieting is speech worthy, and can be quite humorous. 
				Envision your goal. When you are thinking of your ONE goal, create a specific vision of where you would like to be with it in five months. Some examples follow:
			</p>


				<ul>
				<li>tying the shoelaces of your running shoes prior to a spring or summer marathon </li>
				<li>setting up your presentation in the board room of your company </li>
				<li>taking a sip of water before giving a keynote speech to 500 members attending a convention </li>
				<li>addressing members of the homeowners' association, explaining why you should be the group's next president </li>
				<li>making reservations for a second honeymoon, thanks to better communication in your relationship</li>
				<li>accepting your DTM pin at the spring conference</li>
				</ul>
			
			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				...you get the picture.
			</p>


			<h4>We're working for you, the Toastmaster </h4>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>
				

				This special program originated with District Governor Jason Schumacher and is unique to our district. It is being developed with support of Jeff Kirsch, District Governor of Education; Ray Metz, District Governor of Marketing; and Region Adviser Vera Johnson. Production is being delivered by volunteer Toastmasters, with the web portion led by Joe Meirow and the marketing portion led by Liz Cezat. 
			</p>


			<h4>The five-month benchmark </h4>

			<p style='font-size:12pt'>

				Based on program performance, we may cap it at five months (May 2014) with hearty applause. With this great start, you’ll be well on your way to achieving your goal on your own. However, if interest remains strong, we’ll continue the ONE Goal to a Better Life program throughout 2014. 
				
			<h4>Your reward</h4>
			<p style='font-size:12pt'>

				This effort will be "high 5'd" at the spring conference. A raffle of participants will dole out some special prizes, including:
				<ul>
					<li>A full-paid registration to the spring conference</li>
					<li>A plane-ride in Jeff Kirsch's private plane (4 lucky winners) will head to XXXX for lunch</li>
					<li>All participants will get a "Ask me about my ONE Goal" pin or pen</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div style='font-size:12pt;margin-left:30px;'>
					<h4 style='font-size:12pt'>Tell Your Story</h4>

					If you attend the spring conference, be ready to participate in a Table Topics about your journey in striving for your goal.
				</div>

			</p>

			<h4>Get a Bonus</h4>
				<p style='font-size:12pt'>
			
					In the process of reaching your personal goal, you will also be hitting Toastmaster benchmarks, e.g. CC manual completion, High Performance Leadership (HPL) project, and CL (competent leader) manual completion. 
				</p>
				
			<h4>Rules to Follow</h4>
			
				<p style='font-size:12pt'>
			
					You must update your goal weekly to be eligible for the final drawing. 
					The Toastmaster team will send bi-weekly e-mails to you, which will also be posted on the ONE goal website. Commit to opening these e-mails to get added motivation to keep taking action toward your goal.
